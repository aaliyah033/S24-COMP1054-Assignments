                    Oh, woah
                    Woah, woah
                    
                    Like a moth to a flame
                    I'll pull you in, I pulled you back to
                    What you need initially
                    
                    It's just one call away
                    And you'll leave him, you're loyal to me
                    But this time, I let you be
                    <span>
                    'Cause he seems like he's good for you
                    And he makes you feel like you should
                    And all your friends say he's the one
                    His love for you is true</span> 
                    <!-- used span to divide the text for specific font and color -->
                    But does he know you call me when he sleeps?
                    But does he know the pictures that you keep?
                    But does he know the reasons that you cry?
                    Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
                    Where it truly lies
                    
                    Yeah, you should be with him
                    I let you go from time
                    You should stay with him
                    
                    'Cause he seems like he's good for you
                    And he makes you feel like you should
                    And all your friends say he's the one
                    His love for you is true (hey)
                    <span>
                    But does he know you call me when he sleeps? (No, no)
                    But does he know the pictures that you keep? (Yeah)
                    But does he know the reasons that you cry?
                    Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
                    Where it truly lies </span>
                    
                    Right here with me, babe
                    Where it truly lies
                    In my bed, babe
                    Where it truly lies
                    
                    In my arms, babe
                    Where it truly lies 
                    <span>Oh, oh, where it truly lies</span>
                    
                    Where it truly lies
                    (Hey)
                    Where it truly lies</p>
